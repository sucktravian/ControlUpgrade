# Windows Upgrade Control


[⬇️ Download Latest Release](https://github.com/sucktravian/ControlUpgrade/releases/latest)

A simple WPF app I built to make it easier to block or unblock Windows upgrades using registry keys. It comes with a clean interface, dark mode toggle, and some basic localization (English and Japanese).

I mainly made this to avoid digging through the registry manually every time. Sharing it in case it's useful to others too.

## Features

- 🔒 Lock/unlock Windows upgrade behavior  
- 🌗 Toggle between light and dark mode  
- 🧾 View and open relevant registry keys  
- 🌐 Localized (English 🇺🇸 / Japanese 🇯🇵)  
- 🎞 Animated status bar just for fun

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11  
- .NET Desktop Runtime (unless you use the standalone version)

## License

Released under the [GPL v3](LICENSE).  
You’re free to use, share, and modify it — just don’t resell it or remove my name from the code.

This is something I use personally, so it’s not enterprise-grade — but it works well and is open to feedback or improvement!
