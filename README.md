# Windows Upgrade Control

A simple WPF app I built to make it easier to block or unblock Windows upgrades using registry keys. It comes with a clean interface, dark mode toggle, and some basic localization (English and Japanese).

I mainly made this to avoid digging through the registry manually every time. Sharing it in case it's useful to others too.

## Features

- Lock/unlock Windows upgrade behavior
- Toggle between light and dark mode
- View and open relevant registry keys
- Localized (English ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ / Japanese ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ)
- Animated status bar just for fun

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11
- .NET Desktop Runtime (unless you use the standalone version)

This is something I use personally, so itâ€™s not super polished, but it works. Feedback or improvements welcome!
