# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in **ControlUpgrade**, please **do not open a public issue**.

Instead, open a new [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/sucktravian/ControlUpgrade/issues/new) and prefix the title with `[SECURITY]`. Please include as much detail as possible to help us investigate and resolve the issue.

Weâ€™ll work on a fix and coordinate responsible disclosure before sharing details publicly.

Thank you for helping keep the project safe!
